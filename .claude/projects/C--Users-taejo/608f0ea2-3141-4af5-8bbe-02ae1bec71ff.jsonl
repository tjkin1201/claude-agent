Now in preview, Gemini CLI provides powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting.\n\n## Key Features and Capabilities\n\n### Coding and Programming Features\nGemini CLI provides powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting. It offers a fundamental upgrade to your command line experience, enabling you to write code, debug issues and streamline your workflow.\n\n**Specific coding capabilities include:**\n- Query and edit large codebases in and beyond Gemini's 1M token context window\n- Generate new apps from PDFs or sketches, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities\n- Automate operational tasks, like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases\n- Writing code, debugging issues, managing projects, querying documentation, and explaining code\n\n### Technical Architecture\nThe Gemini CLI uses a reason and act (ReAct) loop with your built-in tools and local or remote MCP servers to complete complex use cases like fixing bugs, creating new features, and improving test coverage.\n\n### Free Tier and Access\nTo use Gemini CLI free-of-charge, simply login with a personal Google account to get a free Gemini Code Assist license. That free license gets you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and its massive 1 million token context window. To ensure you rarely, if ever, hit a limit during this preview, we offer the industry's largest allowance: 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day at no charge.\n\n### Integration and Extensibility\nIts power comes from built-in tools allowing you to: Ground prompts with Google Search so you can fetch web pages and provide real-time, external context to the model · Extend Gemini CLI's capabilities through built-in support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or bundled extensions · Customize prompts and instructions to tailor Gemini for your specific needs and workflows · Automate tasks and integrate with existing workflows by invoking Gemini CLI non-interactively within your scripts.\n\n### Agent Mode Integration\nGemini CLI brings AI directly into the command line, eliminating context switching by letting developers ask questions, generate code and debug right in their terminal. Taking this further, Gemini Code Assist's new agent mode acts as an AI pair programmer. It analyzes your entire codebase to plan and execute complex, multi-file tasks — like implementing new features or performing large refactors, all from a single prompt, significantly accelerating the development process.\n\n### Platform Support and Installation\nGemini CLI runs on Mac, Linux (including ChromeOS) and Windows; and unlike Claude Code or Codex, the Windows version is native rather than requiring WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).\n\n### Security Features\nGemini CLI operates as a local agent with built-in security measures that address common concerns about AI command execution. The system requires explicit user confirmation for each command, with options to \"allow once,\" \"always allow\" or deny specific operations.\n\n### Open Source Nature\nBecause Gemini CLI is fully open source (Apache 2.0), developers can inspect the code to understand how it works and verify its security implications.\n\nThe tool represents Google's significant push into the developer CLI space, competing directly with similar offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic, but distinguishing itself through its generous free tier and open-source approach."}]},"uuid":"aa0fbf75-e57d-464b-809a-64fee93b0a16","timestamp":"2025-07-28T11:54:28.785Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Gemini CLI Google 2025 features capabilities coding programming","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0189bCZfoPvW373MyeC5Asjq","content":[{"title":"Google announces Gemini CLI: your open-source AI agent","url":"https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/"},{"title":"GitHub - google-gemini/gemini-cli: An open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal.","url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli"},{"title":"Gemini Code Assist’s June 2025 updates: Agent Mode arrives","url":"https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-code-assist-updates-july-2025/"},{"title":"Gemini CLI | Gemini Code Assist | Google for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli"},{"title":"Google unveils Gemini CLI, an open source AI tool for terminals | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/google-unveils-gemini-cli-an-open-source-ai-tool-for-terminals/"},{"title":"Gemini CLI | Gemini for Google Cloud","url":"https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli"},{"title":"Google positions itself for 'next decade' of AI as Gemini CLI arrives with generous free tier • DEVCLASS","url":"https://devclass.com/2025/06/25/google-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier/"},{"title":"Google Releases Gemini CLI: Free and Open-Source AI Agent for Developers","url":"https://www.androidsage.com/2025/06/25/google-releases-gemini-cli-for-developers/"},{"title":"Gemini Code Assist overview | Google for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/overview"},{"title":"Forget about AI costs: Google just changed the game with open-source Gemini CLI that will be free for most developers | VentureBeat","url":"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-is-redefining-enterprise-ai-economics-with-open-source-gemini-cli-that-will-be-free-for-the-majority-of-developers/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Google's Gemini CLI features and capabilities for coding and programming in 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nGoogle's Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal, and it's open source.
