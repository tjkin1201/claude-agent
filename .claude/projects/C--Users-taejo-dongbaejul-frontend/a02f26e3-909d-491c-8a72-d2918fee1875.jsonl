Test offline message queuing and sync.\n\n---\n\n**Task 9: Implement Push Notifications and Offline Support**\nDescription: Add push notification system for messages and announcements, with offline data caching\nStatus: pending\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 5, 6\nImplementation Details: Set up Expo Notifications with proper permission handling and device token management. Create NotificationService for sending targeted notifications (new messages, announcements, game updates). Implement offline data caching using AsyncStorage with sync mechanisms. Add offline queue for messages and posts. Create notification preferences and settings screen. Implement badge count updates for unread messages and notifications.\nTest Strategy: Test push notifications on both iOS and Android with various app states. Verify offline data persistence and sync when reconnected. Test notification permissions and user preferences. Validate badge count accuracy and notification routing.\n\n---\n\n**Task 10: Optimize Performance and Add Final Polish Features**\nDescription: Implement performance optimizations, accessibility features, and final UI/UX improvements\nStatus: pending\nPriority: low\nDependencies: 7, 8, 9\nImplementation Details: Optimize image loading with lazy loading and caching strategies. Implement list virtualization for large member and message lists. Add accessibility labels and screen reader support following WCAG guidelines. Create loading states and error boundaries for better UX. Add pull-to-refresh functionality across screens. Implement dark mode support with theme switching. Add haptic feedback for gym environment usability. Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting.\nTest Strategy: Performance test with large datasets and slow network conditions. Validate accessibility with screen readers and voice control. Test dark mode switching and theme persistence. Verify pull-to-refresh and loading states across all screens. Conduct usability testing in gym environment.\n\n---\n\n**Task 5: Build Board System with Announcements and Comments**\nDescription: Implement bulletin board system with announcements, categorization, and commenting functionality\nStatus: pending\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 3, 4\nImplementation Details: Create BoardService with CRUD operations for posts and comments. Implement BoardScreen with categorized posts (pinned announcements, general announcements, free board). Build PostDetailScreen with comment/reply system. Add image attachment support using Expo ImagePicker. Implement search functionality for title, content, and author. Create admin-only post creation/editing for announcements. Add rich text formatting for post content.\nTest Strategy: Test post creation, editing, and deletion with proper permission controls. Verify comment threading and reply functionality. Test image upload and display. Validate search functionality with Korean text. Test pagination and loading states."},"uuid":"3b3d3cd9-4aa0-40d2-a1b3-bd2b24e6afcf","timestamp":"2025-08-06T11:21:23.186Z"}
