Generate exactly 7 subtasks based on the provided prompt and context.\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing a single key \"subtasks\" whose value is an array of the generated subtask objects.\nEach subtask object in the array must have keys: \"id\", \"title\", \"description\", \"dependencies\", \"details\", \"status\".\nEnsure the 'id' starts from 1 and is sequential.\nFor 'dependencies', use the full subtask ID format: \"6.1\", \"6.2\", etc. Only reference subtasks within this same task.\nEnsure 'status' is 'pending'.\nDo not include any other text or explanation. \n\n Always respond in English.\n\nHuman: Divide into: Socket.IO client setup with reconnection logic, ChatService for message handling and persistence, main group ChatScreen with message bubbles and typing indicators, private messaging system with conversation history, push notification integration, message status tracking, and offline message queuing\n\n\nComplexity Analysis Reasoning: Very high complexity due to real-time communication, Socket.IO integration, message persistence, push notifications, offline handling, and cross-platform considerations. Critical for user engagement but technically challenging.\n\n# Project Context\n\n## Task Context\n\n**Task 6: Implement Real-time Chat System with Socket.IO**\nDescription: Create group chat and private messaging system with real-time communication capabilities\nStatus: in-progress\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 4\nImplementation Details: Set up Socket.IO server connection with automatic reconnection and connection pooling. Create ChatService for message handling, history, and persistence. Build ChatScreen for main group chat with message bubbles, typing indicators, and emoji reactions. Implement private messaging with user selection and conversation history. Add push notification support using Expo Notifications. Create message status indicators (sent, delivered, read). Implement offline message queuing.\nTest Strategy: Test real-time message delivery between multiple clients. Verify message persistence and history loading. Test private chat creation and message routing. Validate push notifications on background/closed app states. Test offline message queuing and sync.\n\n---\n\n**Task 2: Implement Naver Band OAuth Authentication System**\nDescription: Set up Naver Band OAuth integration for user authentication and basic member information retrieval\nStatus: done\nPriority: high\nDependencies: 1\nImplementation Details: Configure Naver Band OAuth 2.0 flow using expo-auth-session. Create authentication service with login/logout functions, token management, and automatic token refresh. Implement secure token storage using Expo SecureStore. Set up API wrapper for Band API calls with proper error handling and retry logic. Create AuthContext for managing authentication state across the app.\nTest Strategy: Test OAuth flow on both platforms with valid Band accounts. Verify token persistence across app restarts. Test logout functionality and token expiration handling. Mock Band API responses for testing without live authentication.\nSubtasks: 6 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 9: Implement Push Notifications and Offline Support**\nDescription: Add push notification system for messages and announcements, with offline data caching\nStatus: pending\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 5, 6\nImplementation Details: Set up Expo Notifications with proper permission handling and device token management. Create NotificationService for sending targeted notifications (new messages, announcements, game updates). Implement offline data caching using AsyncStorage with sync mechanisms. Add offline queue for messages and posts. Create notification preferences and settings screen. Implement badge count updates for unread messages and notifications.\nTest Strategy: Test push notifications on both iOS and Android with various app states. Verify offline data persistence and sync when reconnected. Test notification permissions and user preferences. Validate badge count accuracy and notification routing.\n\n---\n\n**Task 5: Build Board System with Announcements and Comments**\nDescription: Implement bulletin board system with announcements, categorization, and commenting functionality\nStatus: pending\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 3, 4\nImplementation Details: Create BoardService with CRUD operations for posts and comments. Implement BoardScreen with categorized posts (pinned announcements, general announcements, free board). Build PostDetailScreen with comment/reply system. Add image attachment support using Expo ImagePicker. Implement search functionality for title, content, and author. Create admin-only post creation/editing for announcements. Add rich text formatting for post content.\nTest Strategy: Test post creation, editing, and deletion with proper permission controls. Verify comment threading and reply functionality. Test image upload and display. Validate search functionality with Korean text. Test pagination and loading states.\n\n---\n\n**Task 3: Create Main Navigation Structure and Home Screen Layout**\nDescription: Build the bottom tab navigation with stack navigators and implement the main dashboard home screen\nStatus: done\nPriority: high\nDependencies: 1, 2\nImplementation Details: Set up React Navigation 6 with bottom tab navigator containing Home, Board, Chat, Photos, and Games tabs. Create stack navigators for each tab. Implement HomeScreen with club information display, latest announcements (top 3), member count, and quick action buttons. Use React Native Paper components following Material Design 3 principles. Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes with proper spacing and typography.\nTest Strategy: Test navigation between all tabs and stack screens. Verify back button behavior and deep linking. Test layout responsiveness on different screen sizes. Ensure proper tab highlighting and navigation state management."},"uuid":"39930d9e-8e5c-4846-8522-916f84bbcc8c","timestamp":"2025-08-06T11:46:55.355Z"}
